3,"Sorry, America's Military Record Is A Lot Worse Than You Think It Is","before I start, I'm British.

I don't think a great deal of this, it's too political, in many of the wars it mentions there is a clear military victory but the article casts it as a loss because, politically, it wasn't massively beneficial. I would be fine with this if that was the purpose of the article, but the title only concerns itself with with the military aspect of it.

Oh, and it makes a cheap dig at the French military, who have actually had a pretty successful history in warfare. "
4,"Atheists always ask me for ""evidence"" of God, yet the standard model of cosmology today consists of a universe where 74% of the total mass-energy is comprised of a hypothetical substance that has yet to be observed.","While I see the point you are trying to make there is one difference between the two. 

Scientists are still trying to understand the dark matter/energy problem and learn about it. They hope to use that knowledge to improve, modify or completely replace the Standard Model. This constant learning process was how we learned about the ""missing"" mass/energy. 

As a whole cosmology continues to move forward with many various theories and explanations. As far as evidence for the Standard Cosmological model there is there is plenty of it (Microwave background, galactic red-shift, etc...) This might not be able to explain EVERYTHING we observe but it provides sufficient weight to not reject it outright especially since it does give us the ability to predict certain things with accuracy. 

Where has the ""God model"" moved in the past thousands of years? Any closer to the evidence?

11,Woops! Study Accidentally Finds Chemotherapy Makes Cancer Far Worse,"oh, god, not again. *sigh*
listen, chemo has already been well-known to increase the chance of cancer recurrence above baseline... since it was first used almost 100 years ago. also, many chemo drugs are derived directly from chemicals initially isolated from plants - mass production by chemical synthesis of the same molecules is what drove chemotherapy in the '60s! anyway, the point of chemo is that the recurrence rate is less risky (by far) than the risk of not treating the cancer. this is absolutely nothing new, and if you read the actual paper very superficially (and selectively) written up in the blog post, it acknowledges that. different cancers have different responses to chemo, so there are many, many types of chemo that prevent uncontrolled growth through different biological pathways. the problem is, healthy cells also ALWAYS get some of the nasty effects, particularly rapidly-reproducing cells in the gut and skin (think hair follicles). chemo drugs are, by law, extensively tested for a period often reaching 11 years in order to ensure effectiveness while minimizing (as much as possible) negative side-effects. the process of approval by the FDA for therapy is grueling, particularly for cancer. the authors are merely reporting results of tissue biopsies from men that had been treated for prostate cancer by one particular type of chemotherapeutic drug. there is NO mention of ANY increase in mortality (how could there be? these men were not even followed!), and no increased cancer risk beyond what is already expected. the study merely looked at expression of a certain protein post-treatment and mentioned that is could be the biophysical reason for WHY that particular drug has the post-successful-treatment cancer risk ALREADY KNOWN. whoever wrote this article is clearly making shit up to push their own viewpoint, and apparently hasn't taken a single science course, since IT'S COMMON FUCKING KNOWLEDGE THAT CHEMO CAN CAUSE CANCER. again, it's just a risk-benefit analysis determined by hundreds upon thousands of man-hours spent thoroughly researching every cancer drug that comes on the market. 

the turmeric and cumin (actually curcumin) studies mentioned are simply starting blocks for further research. here's why: the curcumin study tested breast cancer cell response *in vitro* (meaning, in test tubes), which ignores interaction from all the complex biology of living tissue in the human body. it was merely a study, like many others, to determine possible biological anti-cancer mechanisms for a plant-based set of organic compounds. MORE RESEARCH IS REQUIRED, and is being conducted; drug companies have started by improving on known plant sources of antimitotic and apoptotic agents for decades! the turmeric study, on the other hand, involved injecting rats into their interperitoneal cavities (stomach areas) for days with extremely high doses of highly-purified turmeric extract, and then simply determining if there was ANY reduction in a specific type of brain tumor size (glioblastoma). it's not hard to get a good result with those criteria if you're using a compound already known to have some anti-mitotic effects! most importantly, it was given in ADDITION to cisplatin and doxorubicin, which makes this study absolute nonsense, since it was comparing rats taking KNOWN, effective chemo drugs combined with a possible novel one against rats taking NO DRUGS AT ALL. and yet they claim to have found no evidence of toxic effects in the first group of rats... guess that says the established drugs are safe, too, huh ;) just a shitty study that this blog's author obviously found by typing 'turmeric alternative therapies' into PubMed, without actually reading anything in the abstract.

Blog authors like him or her are part of the reason why so many of us are skeptical of homeopathic 'medicine;' you can't have crackpots make inflated claims and write incredibly biased articles promoting things they haven't even bothered to research properly themselves. Seriously, don't believe all you see online (I guess that includes me, but I have no reason to lead you astray)."

24,Michael Jackson has passed away,"Michael Jackson was a tragically sad individual.

Say what you want, the man was severely abused as a child, and went on to retreat completely into his fantasy world, where he'd never have to grow up or face what happened to him.  His wealth allowed him to surround himself with yes-people who never questioned him, and never encouraged him to seek help.  He alienated the people who truly cared about him, because they reminded him of his hurtful, negative past.

The real tragedy came when he went on to perpetuate the cycle of abuse with other children, whom he did truly, truly love ... but not in an age-appropriate manner.  On another site I saw someone mention that he really saw himself as a child, which is quite true.  MJ wanted so desperately to be a child again, that he fell in love with everything about young children.

I'm not defending pedophilia, I find what he did to be wrong and not at all appropriate ... but the only thing I can find myself feeling about his whole situation is sadness.

He was an extraordinarily talented individual, and it's sad that all of the allegations and atrocities that came out of the 90's will eclipse all of that.  He gave us some industry-changing music, some of the best pop-music of all time.

This whole situation is just really, really awful.

33,"How can someone have both ADHD and autism? -from a neurologist in training (long post, tldr at bottom)","Your understanding of ADHD is very far from how it is approached clinically. A ""short attention span"" is not at all the best way or even a good way to summarize attention deficit symptoms. Much more typical is the challenge to chose between non-salient stimuli to direct and maintain attention toward. In ADHD, it becomes extremely hard to focus on uninteresting tasks.

&#x200B;

>ADHD can actually be objectively diagnosed with continuous performance tests, such as the Test of Variables of Attention and Conners Continuous  Performance Test.

74,Can Men Speak About Abortion?,"I believe that men should talk about abortion all they want. Men are half of the cause of it, they are ""intimately"" involved in the conditions which lead to abortion. And men have the responsibility to care for children etc.

It's not any person's right to tell any one woman what must happen when she becomes pregnant, what rights she may or may not have over her own body, or what she should decide as her own best interests. In this way, all men and all women are equal, except for the pregnant woman who actually gets to make the decision for herself.

Just because you can get pregnant doesn't mean that you hold any extra sway over someone who is.

This post is ridiculous. Even if we ignore the assumption that people arguing for capitalism aren’t well read on the subject, reading four books won’t magically change the argument in any way.

Or are you just a deluded, 25-year-old child trying to play make-believe in an economy you have zero control over to feel better about yourself?

90,How Capitalism Works,"This reads like fan fiction rather than the critical analysis you claimed so many others were incapable of. 

Where I live local grocers coexist in the market with large supermarket chains because they service very different needs. The compelling emotional anecdote you spun seems to omit this reality and paints the scene of a capitalist world where giant monopolies that crush all other enterprise are all that exist.

Arguing against monopolist capitalism is a good premise, but the socialist/communist solution is typically to institute a system of state-run monopolies - which enjoy all the power of a capitalist monopoly with none of the incentive to manage resources efficiently.

A more suitable solution exists in lowering the barriers to entry for new enterprise and conserving anti-trust regulation.  A more competitive market is a better market for the consumer.

128,Breeder Trolls who ambivalent about kids and then purposefully had them: What are the positives of having kids? (more in comments),"ughhhh I hate that term ""breeders.""  It's horrible.

I've had an overall positive experience with my kid.  I'll share!  

**Pregnancy**

Keep in mind that pregnancy varies widely.  Everyone's body is very different.  Since you're looking for positive arguments, I'll just give you the pros of my pregnancy (there were cons too).  Around the second trimester, I felt happy.  I mean, I had bad days and I was more emotional than usual, but I felt happier than I'd felt in a long time.  The hormones did some good stuff for me.  I hardly gained any weight, so I ended up being a thin pregnant lady with a baby bump and I got a lot of compliments.  No stretch marks, no saggy boobs, and my feet somehow became half a size smaller.  And we got to have a big party with our friends and family (aka the baby shower).  We invited men and women and had delicious food, cake, and a keg.  Fun times.

**Giving Birth**

I had a high risk birth and it certainly wasn't pleasant.  The positives though.  Hmmm.  My epidural rocked.  The actual pushing took less than an hour.  I did not feel myself tear or the doctor stitch me up.  Doing skin-to-skin after was aaammmaaazzzinnggggg.  Ugh, just thinking about it makes me want to go get my son out of bed to cuddle.

OH and vaginal tightness generally returns to normal after the first kid.  (I think maybe after the second one too?  Not sure.)

**Breastfeeding**

You don't have to breastfeed, but there are benefits.  It reduces your risk for breast cancer.  It's a good way of bonding.  It's super healthy for the kid.  It's readily available, so there's no warming up bottles at 2 AM.  And when you nurse, your body releases oxytocin!  It's magical!  I LOVE breastfeeding.  It was difficult and a little painful at first, and you can get mastitis which sucks, but overall I have enjoyed it sooo much.  And still no saggy boobs!  (Be warned that whether you breastfeed or use formula, someone WILL give you shit for your choice.)  

**Being a Parent**

There really isn't anything like it in the world.  When people say you don't know true love until you have a kid, they're wrong.  You can know true love with your partner.  You can feel it with your family members and even very close friends.  But love for your child is a different type of love completely (like love for your partner is way different than love for your parents).  It's intense.  It's instinctual and animalistic at first, but as you get to know your kid, you begin to love him or her for more than just being a combination of yours and your partner's genes.  You begin to love their little personality.  You will love to watch him or her grow.  To hit milestones.  To learn language.  To exhibit behaviors that you once exhibited.  Your little one will become his or her own person, and you will love that person.  

You get to relive the good parts of your childhood.  Loved Halloween as a kid?  You get to do it all over again as a parent.  Loved trips to the children's section of the library?  You get to do it again.  Loved learning woodworking/knitting/crafts from your parents?  Now you get to teach it!

My son will be two next month, and while I have best friends, and my husband is my very best friend, my son is my best friend too.  I love taking him with me to run errands.  I love taking him to the library or the park or wherever.  I love taking him out to lunch and sharing dessert after.  I just love his company.  I love to hear him laugh.  I love hearing the excitement in his voice when he talks about the things he loves--namely trucks, trains, Care Bears, and nursing.  I love watching his curiosity.  I loved watching him take his first bite of pizza.  I love when he runs up to me just to give me a hug.  I love when he brings me my slippers and phone in the morning (because he's just a sweetheart like that).  I love when he tells me that he is currently wearing two brown shoes.  I just fucking love that little boy.

I don't really care for most other kids.  I don't hate them--they're just innocent little people with little awareness, how could I hate them?  But I don't *care* for them or want to be around them.  But I love being around my son.  He is beautiful and smart and funny and amazing.  And you will feel the same way about your own kid.

Don't get me wrong--I don't think anyone should have kids unless they want to.  It's obviously a lifelong commitment.  But if you do end up deciding you want one, things will be hard and you will want to scream sometimes, but you will fucking enjoy it.

129,Trolls...do any of you practice chakra balancing/meditation/etc?,"I have zero idea what the image you posted means, but I meditate daily and contribute it to my low stress levels.

I just don't get it, I guess.

**edit:** I've gotten a few comments that are under the impression that I want this picture taken down. This is not what I'm talking about. 

When I first came to /r/atheism years ago, I was happy I found solidarity and a comfortable spot where I could talk with nonreligious people, having dropped my Christian faith while still residing in a conservative area. But over the years, this sub has become downright hostile. You can disagree with religious views; I do too. You can post whatever you want, including a picture of Jesus getting raped. But if this sub is to be a representative (it is, after all, touted to be the largest atheist forum) of atheism, then it should held to higher standard where we champion rational thought and free thinking, not hostility towards others. In light of recent events such as the Paris shooting, I totally get people are angry with religious followers. I get that. But this was something that was voted to the front page of Reddit, and it makes /r/atheism look bad. 

**edit #2:** You guys convinced me; I'm unsubscribing to this sub (yeah, I know, boo-freaking-hoo). If I sound like I'm being butthurt by a picture, it's more than that. It's the attitude I've gotten here time and time again. I got constant comments like ""If you don't like it, THEN JUST LEAVE!"" And you know what? They're absolutely right. I hope subscribers on here realize how they appear to religious users who may lurk here or see the pages that get upvoted to the front page. I feel like /r/atheism subscribers don't give a shit, but they really should. If we are to convince Christians, Muslims, Mormons, etc. that skepticism and critical thinking are better methods to reach ethical choices and scientific progress, then let's act that way. Today was a good example of the disappointment I've been getting here constantly."

I know that some mobile apps don’t display the rules in an easily accessible way, so I’ll list them here:

**No Alt-Right/Nazis** This sub is a place for all those who oppose the alt-right/Nazis and their associated and supporting groups. Users from the following groups are prohibited from participating here: alt-right/Nazis, far-right, “alt-light,” “identitarian,” white supremacists, white nationalists, incels, MAGA-trolls, and members of any political affiliation whom the moderators of this sub deem to be enablers and supporters of the aforementioned groups.

___



**Shitpost Properly, If At All** Avoid low-effort shitposts, such as overused reaction gifs, bad ""daily struggle"" comics, “banned from” posts, “search results” posts, and posts directly asking for upvotes. We tend to let the upvotes do the talking, but even if a really bad post hits r/all we will remove it.

___


**Focus on the Alt-Right**
I won't pretend there is a tremendous amount of material to go off on the alt-right, and generally any criticism of the current administration that condones and promotes the alt-right is OK. Off-topic posts will be removed, though. However, content related to the Mueller investigation into criminal activity by the Trump administration as well as related material is allowed at this time.


___



**Absolutely No Brigading**
Do not vote in linked threads. This is considered brigading and can lead to site-wide ban. It's better if you use archive sites or screenshots instead of a direct link. We understand that reddit is administrated rather lopsidedly, but we ask that you remain within the rules.
No Reposts No reposts. Please take a few seconds to make sure your post haven't been posted here previously.


___



**No Reposts** No reposts. Please take a few seconds to make sure your post haven't been posted here previously.


___



**No Bigotry** No bigotry, including racism, sexism, islamophobia, and ableism. Sarcastic use of slurs is not allowed. Sic-quotes containing slurs are allowed. This is bannable offense.


___



**No Useful Idiots, Concern Trolls, or Edgelords.** Alt-right enabling concern trolls and idiots calling for murder can fuck right off. We're not your middle school debate club. Go have some Valuable Discussion™ with Nazis and tell everyone about how they're so terribly misunderstood and how their voices deserve to be heard somewhere else. This includes ""Whataboutism"".


___



**No Rules Lawyering** Interpretation of the rules is left to moderator discretion.


___



From Reddit’s unevenly administered Violent Content policy: **“Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people...”** Violent bigots and proponents of genocide are protected classes on this site. Be smart in the ways you express your condemnation, disgust, and mockery for these deplorables.


___



**No Incivility between Left-Leaning Anti-Nazi Allies.** The sub is fuckthealtright. It’s not fuckliberals, fucksocialists, fuckcommunists, or fuckanarchists. Incivility toward Alt-Right/Nazis is permissible, but follow the guideline: “REPORT then RETORT.”"

208,CMV: Racism against white people in America doesnt matter.,"What if he/she...

...decides to disown their kid for marrying a white person. 

...doesn't let their kid play with a white kid (no matter how much they are best friends at school).

...is in a position to employ someone and refuses to employ someone because they are white.

...treats a white employee worse than the others

...beats up and relentlessly bullies a kid at school because they are white. 

...decides to kill someone because they are white.

Do these things happen all the time? Or as much as they do the other way? No, and no one argues that. But that doesn't mean that they should get away with it with no consequences. Those are all forms of racism.

Now if you are only speaking of people who only think that way but never act on it... well I don't know how many people exist that wouldn't act on it if they were in a position to. 

But say it is just a person who says offensive things about white people but never acts on it ever. You admit it's rude. But why can't a white person or anyone be offended by that. I'm offended by hate speech. I find it disgusting. It doesn't matter who it's coming from, bigoted speech towards any group based off of things that do not affect you is disgusting. I find Bigoted or hateful speech towards an individual usually disgusting. That depends on the person and the exact speech used.

You don't get to be racist consequence free just because others are and have historically been racist towards you. It's not okay to be a dick to everyone in a group due to one thing they can't change. Judge a person on content of their character, not the color of their skin. That goes both ways."
